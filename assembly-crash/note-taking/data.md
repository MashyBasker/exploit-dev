# Data

*Recall*

Every programming language ultimately produces binary which is executed/computed by the CPU. Assembly is just a prettier textual representation of these binary instructions. Each binary statement is mapped to a single assembly statement.

### Why do computers use binary?

Because its easier to map to the on/off states in a digital logic gate. Computer science is the child of Electronics and Mathematics, so these ideas had to be present.

There have been trials with ternary computers, but never became mainstream.

Binary is the standard.

Numbers are represented as binary using powers of 2. Text is represented as ASCII(now UTF-8) which is converted to some decimal number and then binary. 

A single binary digit is called a bit. A collection of bits is called byte. However, because of IBM a byte is also referred to a collection of 8 bits.

**Some common group words**

- Nibble --> half a byte(4 bits)
- Byte --> 8 bits
- Half word/"word" --> 2 bytes(16 bits)
- Double word/dword --> 4 bytes(32 bits)
- Quad word/qword --> 8 bytes(64 bits)
